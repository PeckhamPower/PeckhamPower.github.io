<span style="text-align:center"><p><em>New website under construction...</em></p></span>

<p>We've learnt lots, had fun and quite a rollercoaster ride over the past 5 years - the saga of <a href="http://jack-kelly.com/">Jack</a> <a href="http://jack-kelly.com/insulating_our_victorian_living_room">insulating his Victorian house</a>, draught-busting, the real thing workshops, attending fairs and meeting lots of different people, working on our ambitious electricity meter project, the bid to BIG's Communities Living Sustainably programme for £1 million that we and our partner organisations (the <a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/">London Borough of Southwark</a>, <a href="http://www.familymosaic.co.uk/">Family Mosaic</a>, <a href="http://www.completefabrication.com/">Complete Fabrication</a> and the former <a href="http://www.facebook.com/peckhamsettlement">Peckham Settlement</a>), very sadly, didn't get...</p>

<span style="text-align:center"><p>Now is a good time to thank everyone who's been involved for their past contributions, interest and support.</p></span>

<hr>

<p>Peckham Power is an unincorporated association which has operated
as a social enterprise promoting and delivering energy and
sustainability initiatives in the Peckham area (SE15) since 2008.</p>

<p>It has recently come to our attention that a privately-owned
company registered at EC4 has distributed leaflets including our name
for the purpose of soliciting interest in electricity services in the
Peckham area.  We have no connection with this activity.  Neither have
we given permission for this use of our name.</p>

<p>Formal correspondence with this company is being pursued.</p>
